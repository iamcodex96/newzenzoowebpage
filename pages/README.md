# PAGES

This directory contains your Application Views and Routes.
The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).

The structure of this directory will determine your routes on the webpage so be careful

An index.vue determines the webpage that will be shown in the root

Example

your directory : newzenzoowebpage/pages/index.vue
your webpage : www.zenzoo.es

your directory : newzenzoowebpage/pages/home/index.vue
your webpage : www.zenzoo.es/home

your directory : newzenzoowebpage/pages/home/about.vue
your webpage : www.zenzoo.es/home/about
